### Module 2 Assignment ###

# Creating assignment2 vector #
assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)

# Creating myMean function, this function takes the sum of assignment2 and divides it agains the length of assignment2 and then returns the result. #
myMean <- function(assignment2)
  { 
    return(sum(assignment2)/length(assignment2)) 
}

# Using the function myMean and passing the assignment2 vector against it to provide the mean of the vector. #
myMean(assignment2)
